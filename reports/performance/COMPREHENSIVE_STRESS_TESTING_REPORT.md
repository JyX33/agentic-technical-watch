   - **Impact:** May limit deployment density and increase infrastructure costs
   - **Root Cause:** ML model loading and caching, data processing buffers

2. **Reliability Gap (Medium Priority)**
   - **Issue:** 97.1% success rate vs 99% target
   - **Impact:** 2.9% failure rate may affect user experience
   - **Root Cause:** 5 failed operations out of 174 total

### No Critical Bottlenecks

- CPU utilization is excellent (38.7% peak)
- Response times are well below targets
- Throughput exceeds requirements
