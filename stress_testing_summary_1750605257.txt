REDDIT TECHNICAL WATCHER - STRESS TESTING REPORT
============================================================

Production Readiness: FAIR - Needs optimization before production
Overall Score: 74.3%

VALIDATION RESULTS:
✅ PASS throughput_target: 60.00 (target: 50)
✅ PASS response_time_target: 0.39 (target: 5.0)
❌ FAIL reliability_target: 0.79 (target: 0.99)

TEST SUMMARY:
Tests: 6/7 successful
Operations: 130/164 successful
Average Throughput: 5.6 ops/sec

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Consider optimizing ML model inference pipeline - throughput below 20 posts/sec
2. High memory usage detected (9776MB) - implement memory optimization strategies
3. Database connection pool may need optimization - consider increasing pool size
4. Overall success rate (79.3%) below 95% - improve error handling and resilience
