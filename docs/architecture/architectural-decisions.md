## ADR-001: Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Adoption

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-06-15
**Deciders**: Architecture Team, Engineering Team

### Rationale
- **Standardization**: Industry-standard protocol with clear specifications
- **Future-Proofing**: Compatibility with emerging A2A ecosystem
- **Service Discovery**: Built-in agent card system for dynamic discovery
- **Tooling**: Available SDKs and development tools
- **Scalability**: Designed for distributed agent systems

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear communication contracts between agents
- Built-in service discovery mechanism
- Industry-standard approach aids future integration
- Well-defined error handling patterns
- Standardized monitoring and observability

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity compared to simple HTTP APIs
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with A2A
- Dependency on A2A SDK and protocol evolution
- JSON-RPC overhead compared to REST

### Alternatives Considered
1. **REST APIs**: Simpler but lacks service discovery

## ADR-002: Microservices Architecture with Specialized Agents

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-06-15
**Deciders**: Architecture Team

### Context
